## CAS 05-23-17

First thing to do is to reroute the html output of the bokeh plot function. I want one html output per pfam term in the appropriate pfam term folder. 

Also want to add a legend to the bokeh figure. It&#39;s been pretty straightforward. Just need to add legend keyword when calling rectFig. Going to add a legend column to the source DataFrame. 

I also need to add in the possibility of having more than 11 (12?) key terms that I want to reserve colors for. The way it&#39;s working right now, if it&#39;s more than that (the colorbrewer maximum), it&#39;s going to crash. But first...need to finish the legend.

Got the legend working alright. Had to add a legend list to the data_dict, but that wasn&#39;t a huge deal. Just maps everything into the dict as either one of the key terms or &#39;other&#39;. 

I&#39;m going to comment out the part of the code that doesn&#39;t regenerate the data_dict and dataframe everytime the plot gets made. It doesn&#39;t take any serious amount of time and I keep updating what goes into the df and data_dict so I think it&#39;s worth regenerating it all the time. 

Pruning Key Terms
-----
I wrote a function in the analyze.py script called prune_key_terms(pfam_target). It goes in and only keeps the lines from the loaded DataFrame that have less than a certain amount of found key terms. The idea here was to see if there&#39;s any sequences that have Cas9_REC and don&#39;t have the others. It looks like maybe there is...probably worth checking out tomorrow. I&#39;ll include the resulting plot here. 

Also...I want to make the coloring consistent. How can I do that given the current way color mappings are generated? Also forgot to fix the bug where more than 11 (12?) key terms will crash everything. The way I&#39;m going to keep the color mapping consistent is by sorting the key terms alphabetically. That way at least when I have the same number of key terms, it should map to the same color. Dunno about when I have different number of key terms...but that&#39;s not a huge deal I think. 

Wrote an exclude key terms as well to look at sequences without excluded terms. 

Note that I now have separate .txt files for excluding, pruning, and coloring in the all-sequences map (key_terms.txt).
