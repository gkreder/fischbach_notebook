## CAS 05-22-17

So going back into the Bokeh code for HSV it looks like the end result I need to plug into the rectangle plot is a pandas dataFrame that will associate a color to each entry. Each entry here will be an element of the PFAM grid. 

I think I should make a data_prep function like I did for HSV but make it generalizable to different PFAM domains. 

I already have the blocks_to_array funciton in the existing CAS data_prep code, I think I can work off of that. 

I&#39;ve set up the data_prep.py script in the top-level CAS folder that looks somewhat like the data_prep script from the HSV folder. A difference here is that the CAS data_prep script functions take a pfam target as an argument so that they can be called with various pfam key terms.

I just created a folder called scripts in the CAS top-directory and threw all the python scripts in there to make things cleaner. Also saw that if you want to import python functions/scripts from somewhere else (another folder) can do

	from application.app.folder.file import func_name
	
**as long as you have a file called __init.py__ inside of that folder**. __init.py__ tells python that the directory can be treated like a package.

I&#39;ve gotten the basic bokeh heatmap plot showing up, now just need to work on the color mapping

Color Mapping
----

Now need to define a color map for the bokeh plot. I can get the key terms as defined in the key_terms file for the pfam_target directory. All I need to do I think is to white out the non-key-term pfam_id entries. 

Also, added .txt extension to key_terms so that I can see the contents in preview. And I am going to rearrange the get_key_terms function so that I can just feed it a pfam_target argument and it will autmatically get the key terms. 


Just looked online and found a python module on pypi that plugs python in to Cynthia Brewer&#39;s colorbrewer website in a straightforward way. It&#39;s called brewer2mpl and I installed it into my fischbach conda environment using pip install. 



Looks like it&#39;s working alright now. I have another heatmap that looks like the HSV one. I think at this point it might be worth taking a second to try to upload these to the notebook? I&#39;m still not sure what the best way of presenting these is, but I think that the bokeh output is a static html file which should plug pretty easily into the lektor notebook format.
