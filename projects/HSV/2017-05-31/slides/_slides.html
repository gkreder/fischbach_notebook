## HSV 05-31-2017

I&#39;ve run into a point with the bokeh plots where I really think I&#39;m gonna lose more time at this point than is worth losing. I&#39;ve implemented the slider and I&#39;ve generated orthomcl datasets for a range of different inflation values. The problem is getting the rectFig to update every time I move the slider. I&#39;ve been able to feed the different source data into the slider callback method but when I try to update, it looks for source data that wasn&#39;t actually included in the static html? I think that&#39;s because when I initialize the actual page, the html document gets written such that the only included source data is the one that is used to initialize the rectangle figure.

I need to think about how to incorporate all the different inflation value source data into the static html that gets initialized, but that&#39;s gonna take a little longer. In the meantime, I think the best thing to do is at least summarize the results I&#39;ve gotten so far in some sort of presentable way for next week. With that in mind, I&#39;ve written a script, analyze_groups.py that&#39;s taking all the group data and churning around with it. I&#39;ve also copied some of the code I wrote earlier (in fetch_test.py) and put it in a script in the HSV scripts folder called fetch_uniprot.py. I&#39;ve also written a couple of object definitions in groups_objects.py to make things a little cleaner. As part of putting together all the data, I want to scrape the uniprot data for the relevant proteins. 

Unfound Proteins
-----
I&#39;m keeping track of which proteins aren&#39;t returning any results from uniprot. They all have names like  NP_042969.2, starting with NP. For these, I&#39;m just going to force a record_dict that is empty (or says something like &#39;unknown&#39;). 

Fixing Bug in Uniprot.py
---
Incorporating the uniprot data into the groups data is going fine so far, but I&#39;ve run into a bug in the uniprot code:

	File &#34;/Users/student/miniconda3/envs/fischbach/lib/python3.6/site-packages/Bio/SeqIO/UniprotIO.py&#34;, line 254, in _parse_comment

		append_to_annotations(ann_key, interact_element.attrib[&#39;intactId&#39;])
	KeyError: &#39;intactId&#39;
	
	
I&#39;m going into the source code of Uniprot.py and catching this error. I&#39;m only going to change the code in the fischbach virtual envirinment version (located at /Users/student/miniconda3/envs/fischbach/lib/python3.6/site-packages/Bio/SeqIO/UniprotIO.py). 

All I&#39;ve done is add a conditional in the source code on line 254:

	# Added by Gabe Reder - 5/31/17
	if &#39;intactId&#39; in interact_element.attrib:
		append_to_annotations(ann_key, interact_element.attrib[&#39;intactId&#39;])
		
So far it looks like that has taken care of the crash and the code is continuing to run now. Finished and got the resulting data in a pkl file
